# Review Staged Changes

Reviews staged git changes to ensure they improve code quality, maintainability, and readability without introducing regressions.

## Workflow

When reviewing staged changes:

1. **Get the staged diff**: `git diff --cached` or `git diff --staged`
2. **Analyze each change** against the four criteria below
3. **Provide structured feedback** using the template in this skill: [templates/review-summary.md](templates/review-summary.md) (relative to the skill directory)

## Review Criteria

### 1. Contextual Sense

Verify changes align with the stated purpose:

- Do the modifications address the intended goal?
- Are related changes grouped logically?
- Is the scope appropriate (not too broad, not too narrow)?
- Are any unrelated changes included that should be in a separate commit?

### 2. Regression Prevention

Identify potential breaking changes:

- **Behavior changes**: Does the code behave differently than before?
- **API changes**: Are function signatures, props, or interfaces modified?
- **Side effects**: Could changes affect other parts of the codebase?
- **Dependencies**: Are imports, dependencies, or external integrations affected?
- **Edge cases**: Are existing edge cases still handled correctly?

**Red flags:**

- Removing error handling without replacement
- Changing return types or function signatures
- Modifying shared utilities without checking usages
- Removing validation or checks
- Changing default values that other code might depend on

### 3. Maintainability & Evolvability

Assess long-term code health:

- **Structure**: Is code better organized (extracted functions, clearer modules)?
- **Complexity**: Is cyclomatic complexity reduced?
- **Coupling**: Are dependencies reduced or better managed?
- **Testability**: Is code easier to test (pure functions, dependency injection)?
- **Documentation**: Are complex parts documented?
- **Patterns**: Are established patterns followed consistently?

**Signs of improvement:**

- Extracting reusable utilities
- Reducing nested conditionals
- Breaking large functions into smaller ones
- Using consistent naming conventions
- Following project architecture patterns

### 4. Readability

Evaluate code clarity:

- **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and types clearly named?
- **Structure**: Is code flow easy to follow?
- **Comments**: Are comments helpful (explain "why", not "what")?
- **Formatting**: Is code consistently formatted?
- **Magic numbers**: Are constants extracted and named?

**Signs of improvement:**

- More descriptive variable names
- Reduced nesting levels
- Clearer control flow
- Better type annotations
- Consistent code style

## Common Patterns to Check

### Refactoring Patterns

**Good refactoring:**

- Extract function → Verify all call sites updated
- Rename variable → Verify all references updated
- Move code → Verify imports and dependencies updated

**Risky refactoring:**

- Changing shared utilities without checking all usages
- Modifying type definitions without updating consumers
- Removing "unused" code that might be used dynamically

### Code Quality Improvements

**Verify improvements are real:**

- Not just moving code around
- Actually reducing complexity
- Actually improving readability
- Making code more testable, not just prettier

### Readability Improvements

**Ensure clarity gains:**

- Names are actually more descriptive
- Structure is genuinely easier to follow
- Comments add value, not noise

## When to Flag Issues

Flag changes if:

- **Critical**: Changes break existing functionality or introduce bugs
- **Warning**: Changes might cause issues or reduce maintainability
- **Suggestion**: Changes could be improved but aren't problematic

Provide specific examples from the diff when flagging issues.
