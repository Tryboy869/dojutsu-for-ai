# Frontend Design Review

Review UI implementations against design quality standards and your design system **OR** create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces from scratch.

## Two Modes

### Mode 1: Design Review
Evaluate existing UI for design system compliance, three quality pillars (Frictionless, Quality Craft, Trustworthy), accessibility, and code quality.

### Mode 2: Creative Frontend Design
Create distinctive interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics, have clear conceptual direction, and execute with precision.

## Creative Frontend Design

Before coding, commit to an aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial, etc.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility requirements.
- **Differentiation**: What makes this distinctive and context-appropriate?

### Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Distinctive fonts that elevate aesthetics. Pair a display font with a refined body font. Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk.
- **Color & Theme**: Cohesive palette with CSS variables. Dominant colors + sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: CSS-only preferred. One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals > scattered micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, grain overlays.

**AVOID**: Overused fonts, cliched color schemes, predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design without context-specific character.

Match implementation complexity to vision. Maximalist = elaborate code. Minimalist = restraint and precision.

## Design Review

### Design System Workflow

**Before implementing:**
1. Review component in your Storybook / component library for API and usage
2. Use Figma Dev Mode to get exact specs (spacing, tokens, properties)
3. Implement using design system components + design tokens

**During review:**
1. Compare implementation to Figma design
2. Verify design tokens are used (not hardcoded values)
3. Check all variants/states are implemented correctly
4. Flag deviations (needs design approval)

**If component doesn't exist:**
1. Check if existing component can be adapted
2. Reach out to design for new component creation
3. Document exception and rationale in code

### Review Process

1. Identify user task
2. Check design system for matching patterns
3. Evaluate aesthetic direction
4. Identify scope (component, feature, or flow)
5. Evaluate each pillar
6. Score and prioritize issues (blocking/major/minor)
7. Provide recommendations with design system examples

### Core Principles

- **Task completion**: Minimum clicks. Every screen answers "What can I do?" and "What happens next?"
- **Action hierarchy**: 1-2 primary actions per view. Progressive disclosure for secondary.
- **Onboarding**: Explain features on introduction. Smart defaults over configuration.
- **Navigation**: Clear entry/exit points. Back/cancel always available. Breadcrumbs for deep flows.

## Quality Pillars

### 1. Frictionless Insight to Action

**Evaluate:** Task completable in ≤3 interactions? Primary action obvious and singular?

**Red flags:** Excessive clicks, multiple competing primary buttons, buried actions, dead ends.

### 2. Quality is Craft

**Evaluate:**
- Design system compliance: matches Figma specs, uses design tokens
- Aesthetic direction: distinctive typography, cohesive colors, intentional motion
- Accessibility: Grade C minimum (WCAG 2.1 A), Grade B ideal (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Red flags:** Generic AI aesthetics, hardcoded values, implementation doesn't match Figma, broken reflow, missing focus indicators.

### 3. Trustworthy Building

**Evaluate:**
- AI transparency: disclaimer on AI-generated content
- Error transparency: actionable error messages

**Red flags:** Missing AI disclaimers, opaque errors without guidance.
