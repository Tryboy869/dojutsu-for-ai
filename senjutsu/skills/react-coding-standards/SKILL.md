# React & TypeScript coding standards

This skill applies company coding standards expressed as **Avoid** (anti-patterns) and **Prefer** (recommended patterns) to **in-code** patterns only. For file and folder naming and structure, use [react-files-structure-standards](../react-files-structure-standards/SKILL.md).

## Reference categories

Standards are defined in the `references/` folder. Load these files when you need the exact Avoid/Prefer rules and examples:

| Category            | File                                                                         | Scope                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coding patterns** | [references/common-coding-patterns.md](references/common-coding-patterns.md) | TypeScript (types, control flow, errors, enums, destructuring, etc.) |
| **Naming patterns** | [references/common-naming-patterns.md](references/common-naming-patterns.md) | In-code naming (boolean prefixes, descriptive names)                 |
| **React patterns**  | [references/common-react-patterns.md](references/common-react-patterns.md)   | Hooks, components, JSX, state, styling, fragments                    |
| **Unit testing**    | [references/common-unit-testing.md](references/common-unit-testing.md)       | Jest, React Testing Library, AAA, mocks, selectors                   |

## Three-phase workflow

When the skill is invoked on code (selected files, git staged files, branch):

### Preliminary — Run linter

1. **Run** the project linter: `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` (use the one that matches the project).
2. **Collect** every reported rule violation (rule id/name, file, line, message).
3. For **each** violation:
   - If the rule is **auto-fixable** (e.g. `--fix` / `eslint --fix`), run the fix (e.g. `yarn lint --fix` or `npm run lint --fix`) and consider the violation resolved.
   - If the fix is **not automatic**, do your best to find a solution with the help of coding guidelines in `references/*.md` (coding → common-coding-patterns, naming → common-naming-patterns, React → common-react-patterns, tests → common-unit-testing) and apply the **Prefer** correction described for that rule.
4. Re-run the linter after fixes; repeat until lint passes or only violations that need manual interpretation remain.

### Phase 1 — Collect violations

1. **Analyze** the provided code against the reference files above.
2. **Identify** every place where the code matches an **Avoid** pattern.
3. **List** each violation in a single report with:
   - **Category** (coding / naming / React / unit testing)
   - **Rule name** (e.g. "Avoid Using `any` for Type Definitions")
   - **Location** (file and line or snippet)
   - **Short reason** (what is wrong)
4. If no Avoid pattern is found, state that the code complies and stop. Otherwise proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Apply corrections

1. For **each** violation in the report:
   - Open the corresponding reference file and find the **Prefer** section paired with that Avoid rule.
   - Apply the recommended correction so the code follows the Prefer pattern.
2. **Preserve** business logic and behavior; only change structure, naming, or patterns.
3. **Prefer minimal edits**: one logical change per violation, no unnecessary rewrites.
4. When several standards apply to the same area, prioritize: TypeScript safety → naming clarity → React architecture → testing structure.

## Rules of thumb

- **Strict avoid/prefer**: Only treat as violations what is explicitly described as Avoid in the reference files; only apply fixes that are explicitly described as Prefer there.
- **One violation, one fix**: One Avoid → one corresponding Prefer; do not mix multiple rules in a single edit unless they target the same line.
- **Readability and maintainability**: After corrections, the code should be easier to read and maintain, without changing behavior.

## Quick reference

- **Lint first**: Run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`; fix auto-fixable issues, then resolve remaining ones using `references/*.md`.
- **Collect next**: Complete the full list of Avoid violations (manual analysis) before making edits.
- **Then redress**: Apply each Prefer in turn, using the reference file as the source of truth.
- **File/folder naming**: Use react-files-structure-standards for normalizing file and folder names and structure.
